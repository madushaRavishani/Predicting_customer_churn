## ðŸ“Š Predict customer churn using machine learning
This project analyzes customer behavior and builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The code includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression), and performance evaluation. Deployed using Google Colab and Python.

## Project Overview 
**Goal**: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) a telecom service using historical data.  
**Key Steps**:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Training and evaluating models (Logistic Regression).
4. Optimizing model performance using a confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Dataset
**Source**: [Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
**Features**: 21 attributes including demographics, contract details, and service usage.  
**Target Variable**: 'Churn'(Yes/No).
